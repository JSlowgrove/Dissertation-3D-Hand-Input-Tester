# Dissertation-3D-Hand-Input
Created during the final year of my undergraduate course at university. This was a basic 3D program that I built as part of my dissertation that was used to test the input of the hand device I was building and translating it to a simple 3D representation. Built in C++ using OpenGL and threading.
